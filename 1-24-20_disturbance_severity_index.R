#From Peterson & Leach:
#Severity indicators = # trees down, BA trees down, % trees down, & % BA down
#"These variables were used as predictor variables in regressions of vegetation response to severity."
# % indices performed better than absolute ones
#Regeneration characteristics = seedling/sapling density, size, 
#species richness (mean per plot), species diversity (Shannon index), & 
#compositional change (Sorensen's: before/after, presence/absence; Chao: incl. abundance-
#I would have to do this comparing cut vs. unharvested instead of before vs. after)

#First step: Create matrices of the severity & regeneration indicators for each site
#(Already pretty much doing that/have done that for severity.)
#Second step: Once we've done that, use two-way ANOVAs to compare for harvested vs. not.
#(Two factors in the ANVOA P&L used were site & harvest status, but found no signif. site effect.)
#Third step: checks with goodness-of-fit tests, see which severity indicators are MOST important
#Fourth step: Use NMS (see: p. 414/ page 8 of the paper)

# Creating severity indicators matrices -------------------------------

#Indicator #1: Number of trees per hectare down (TOTAL, harvested + fallen)
sevind1_numtree <- matrix()

#Indicator #2: Total sum of BA per ha down per site (TOTAL, cut + natural causes)
sevind2_sumBA <- matrix()

#Indicator #3: Proportion of trees down vs. total trees (standing + down)
sevin3_pcttree <- matrix()

#Indicator #4: Proportion of BA down vs. total BA (standing + down)
sevind4_pctBA <- matrix()

#next Q: What does this matrix actually look like?? Rows = sites and columns =...
#One column equals the value for whatever disturb indicator I am using in that one
#Other is...categorical harvest status? For use in ANOVAS- any other vars??
#OR maybe we put these alllll in one matrix? W/ seperate cols for each indicator #

#UPDATE: I've asked Jess about this!
#we will discuss on Wednesday how Jess used a separate script for each trees, stumps, CWD, etc.
#This is dif from how I was planning to do it, basically mimicking what Peterson & Leach did

#OK, based on feedback from Tony, here's the new plan:
#generally, use the Peterson & Leach 2008 approach
#but use biomass as indicator instead of basal area
#analyze @ the plot level, but use stand as a random factor in the regression analysis
#also test if avg years since harvest is an impactful factor
#SO, basically need one big dataframe w/ both amount of biomass cut and proportion of biomass cut
#and then all of the regeneration variables, which are: 
#"Regeneration characteristics included in analyses were seedling/sapling density, 
#size, species richness, species diversity, and compositional change. 
#We calculated mean (per plot) richness (S, the number of species per sample) 
#and Shannon diversity (H0 Â¼R pi log( pi), where pi is the proportion of individuals
#found in the ith species and log is to base 10; Kent and Coker 1994) for 
#salvaged and unsalvaged portions of the wind-disturbed forests as well as for 
#the undisturbed forest at NTSF." -Peterson and Leach 2008

#response variables I should use (I think) include:
#seedling/sapling density (pretty much done)
#sapling (?) sp richness
#sapling (?) Shannon diversity
#size???
#compositional change: Sorensen's index and the Chao-Sorensen similarity index
#I feel like it doesn't make sense to do the similarity indices b/c I don't have
#pre/post data....So instead, I'll stick w/ the sapling richness, diversity, & density
#OR, maybe use those similarity indices to compare harvested vs. unharvested??
#But I've basically already done that w/ the understory complementing PC-ORD...

#and my explanatory variables are amount biomass gone & proportion biomass gone

#methods for biomass calculation (VIA Kurth et al.) = "Biomass pools were estimated 
#using the species-specific allometric biomass equations in Jenkins et al. (2003) 
#and nutrient stocks in all woody components (trees, saplings, shrubs, FWM, and CWM) 
#were estimated using destructive sampling to derive species-specific nutrient
#concentrations as described in Klockow et al. (2014)"

#so, next step = read / look @ those papers for reference on calculating biomass.

#THEN, also need to figure out what the actual math will be re: regressions
#basically, just trying to fit regression equations based on disturbance severity,
#w/ time since harvest & site/stand as potential covariates?

#first step = "spin up" stump height to DBH using equations I've used before.
#then, calculate biomass of all stumps + live trees present.
#going to do this by just re-running some code from the script 08-09-21_stand_basal_area_calcs.R
#and then saving that file, and importing it into this script

overstory_plus$functionaldbh <- overstory_plus$DBH_cm #assigning actual dbh as 'functional' dbh
#but then for stumps, replacing that w/ the stump DBH value caluclated in other script

View(treedata)
#now, want to include ONLY stumps of DC 1 or 2 (b/c we can assume they were cut during harvest,
#whereas older ones probably fell naturally/otherwise)
#test first:
nrow(treedata[(treedata$status=="stump" & treedata$decay_class>2),]) #453 (new val)
nrow(treedata) #5439
treedata <- treedata[!(treedata$status=="stump" & treedata$decay_class>2),]
nrow(treedata) #4987 
#we are off by one number here......
#probably because it's including NAs! (so we are OK b/c there's 1 stump w/ no DC)

### added 4/6/22:
#and now to get rid of SNAGS as well: 
nrow(treedata[treedata$status=="snag",]) #431
treedata <- treedata[treedata$status!="snag",]
nrow(treedata) #4557
#ONCE AGAIN, we are off by one...presumably due to an NA value, so that's OK with me honestly!

####update, the data discrepancies described below have been RESOLVED!

#IMPORTANT THING I JUST FOUND OUT: Hill Roberts site has trees WITHOUT 'status' info!!
#hopefully, this is just the live ones...?

#ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM WITH THE HILL ROBERTS DATA:
#gonna just assign the live class to those trees w/o a "status" 
#ONCE i get the NEW problem below sorted out...

#ALSO ONE MORE DATA DISCREPANCY: 
#there are a few live trees w/ a decay class associated with them (???)
#problematic <- overstory_plus[(overstory_plus$status=="live" & 
#                                !is.na(overstory_plus$decay_class)),]
#problematic2 <- overstory_data[(overstory_data$status=="live" & 
#                                  !is.na(overstory_data$decay_class)),]
#same 5 trees...

#Ok, now what about stumps/snags WITHOUT a decay class, they might be mis-IDed??
#problematic3 <- overstory_plus[((overstory_plus$status=="stump" | 
#                                   overstory_plus$status=="snag") &
#                                  is.na(overstory_plus$decay_class)),]
#ok damn, same issue here w/ 28 stumps/snags
#problematic4 <- overstory_data[((overstory_data$status=="stump" | 
#                                   overstory_data$status=="snag") &
#                                  is.na(overstory_data$decay_class)),]
#NOTE: problematic3 and problematic4 both still have 7 obs but those are 
#truthful to what the paper data sheets reflect! (e.g. DC wasn't recorded)

#NOW WE MUST INVESTIGATE!!! 
#update: investigation completed + fixed (for this analysis, at least!!),
#see workflow doc for details!!!

#OK, now next step is basically to use these biomass allometric equations
#from Jenkins et al. 2003 to estimate above-ground biomass.

#thinking that to do this, I'll write a function to calculate biomass based on DBH
#for each tree; first just need to assign the number (?) to a table w/ all of the 
#species and their associated parameters.
#checking if that exists online first:
#oh hell yeah I found it!: http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/pubs/books/index.html
# originally via https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/7058
#OK JK NEVER MIND this is actually the supplemental tables for a DIFFERENT publication
#BUT it still has the species info per group, it appears, so...gonna go with it!
#first uploading species list w/ associated group code:
specieslist <- read.csv("Jenkins_2004_biomass_tables/Table4_GTR-NE-319.csv")

#next trying to make a column to match w/ my species codes:
#specieslist$ID <- with(specieslist, paste0(gsub("(([A-Za-z]{2})[a-z& ]*)", "\\2", Genus), 
#                                  gsub("(([A-Za-z]{2})[a-z& ]*)", "\\2", Species)))
#specieslist$ID <- toupper(specieslist$ID)
unique(treedata$species[treedata$species %in% specieslist$ID])  #which of my sp DO have matches:
unique(treedata$species[!(treedata$species %in% specieslist$ID)]) #and which don't:

## paused here on 4/6/22...

#treedata2 <- merge(x=treedata, y=specieslist[,c("ID", "Species.group")],
#                        by.x="species", by.y="ID", all.x=TRUE, all.y=FALSE)
#UPDATE, this merge function did NOT really work...
#I might need to bring in my OWN species list....
#or else just do this manually...
my_species_table <- read.csv("C:/Users/theha/OneDrive - University of Vermont/Ash project/EAB_project_2020_additional_data.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
View(my_species_table)
#unique(my_species_table$common_name[my_species_table$common_name %in% specieslist$Common.name])

#OK this assigned MOST of the species to a group.
#but the ones that are left without include:
#unique(treedata$species[!(treedata$species %in% specieslist$ID)])
#and all of those EXCEPT for UNK, NA, and witch hazel do have corresponding values;
#we just gotta find them.
#so, should I ask Tony what to do about unk/NA values (mostly snags + a few stumps)?
#and similarly, should I be including snags in this @ all?
#no mention of them in Kurth et al.; Peterson and Leach says: "Fallen trees and
#snags that were obviously dead prior to 1999 were excluded from sampling."
#BUT does that approach change since we are using BIOMASS instead of basal area?

#TONY SAID: "In terms of your calculations, you only want to use cut stems from 
#the most recent harvest for calculating this.  As for what to do with unknown 
#species, I would average the values for the species group present on site for 
#those calculations. Finally, yes, I would do the seedlings and saplings 
#separately for your calculations."

#so this means: yes get rid of snags (as well as stumps w/ DC >=3, which I already did)
#gonna remove snags then re-run the code directly above to figure out how many/
#which species we don't have values for in the actual subset.

#EDITS MADE ABOVE/THROUGHOUT RE: SNAGS AND DATA ERRORS; PROCEEDING FROM HERE

#tl;dr = nothing signif happening here?? (is that the takeaway?)

#follow-up question: HOW TO CALCULATE R-SQUARED FOR THE REGRESSION FROM THESE MODELS???

#OK I should really move on to saplings...I just don't want to lol

#first, check to make sure there isn't the same species/genus issue for seedlings
#as I had for saplings when doing the PerMANOVA, b/c that affects calculations
#of richness, Shannon index, etc???
unique(seedling_summary$species)
#ok so we DID have this happening..............
#need to figure out what to do about this LATER.............


#WAIT I ALREADY HAVE THESE FROM PC-ORD INPUTS...DUH!!!
#*except* those are aggregated at the stand level...womp womp womp
#but I can probably use the same code, pretty much??
#update: will use PC-ORD code for saplings; seedlings I think will be a lot simpler 

##### following code is imported/modified from PCORD_prep_code_14Jan2022.R 
### IMPORTANT CAVEAT: ALSO NEED TO COMBINE SPECIES W/ 'UNK' SPECIES THE WAY I DID FOR PCORD/
#PERMANOVA ANALYSIS
#WAIT SHOULD I HAVE DONE THAT FOR SAPLINGS TOO??????
