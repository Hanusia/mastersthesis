# preliminary thoughts...  -------------------------------

#for each variable I am analyzing, will create a dataframe w/ these variables to read into

#ALSO, remember that I'll need a way to analyze ash "species" TOGETHER sometimes...

#ACTION ITEM: check how output table of AGbiomass/total biomass is formatted 
#(e.g. is it recording MEAN biomass per species? Chck against total vals extracted from rasters)

#also will need to prep data for input to PC-ORD for ordination....

#NOTE: SEE notes from LANDIS workflow doc on 5/26 to recap/summarize Olivia's & Matthias' methods

#QUESTION FOR TONY/JANE: should I be using nonparametric stats for this since I only have 4 reps?
#IF SO, see Olson paper or Lucash et al. 2017 paper for details on this decision/
#which tests to use instead....

#NMS = most useful to compare RELATIVE biomass between species/scenarios
#but....is it the CHANGE in relative biomass???

#also can calculate Shannon diversity for relative biomass for species- incorporates evenness

#should I do analyses for dominant species along with ash?? (maybe the ones from my first chapter?)
#that would be: red maple, sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch (plus the two ash sp).....
#looks like those four are ALSO the most dominant sp (by avg biomass), at least @ year 0...
#still not sure why red maple is declining so much over time but probably more of a parameters issue

#ASK TONY/JANE:
 #should I also analyze these other species (of interest)?

#Olson used nonparametric tests including: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, Chi-squared test,
#Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and post hoc Wilcoxon rank sum test
#Basically, ask Tony and Jane their thoughts on this

#Matthias also applied "general relativisation" before doing NMS in PC-ORD
#and just did NMS for relative biomass AT YEAR 100 (and at year 200), not CHANGE IN rel biom.

#basically, I don't think I should actually start these analyses til I talk to Tony and Jane...
#but good to be thinking about it first!

#So, to sum up:
#maps of the biomass reclass output x 9 pathways, at year 100 (just pick 1 replicate??), are good visual
#total (all sp.) AGB + individual species (of interest) total AND/OR rel. AGB @ year 100:
#summarize means (in a fig.?) + do 2-way ANOVA (or mixed model anova????? would model type be the random var??)
#for each of those values.

#also ask - should I report biomass in g/m2 or Mg/ha???
#probably Mg/ha, since that's what I did for my other chapter.....

# year 100 live aboveground biomass by sp -------------------------------

#back on 17 June 2022!

#Tony suggested using year 100 biomass & 2-way ANOVA to look @ mgmt x climate.

#use functions from other script to extract values of species AGB

#NOTE: from now on, AGB = live aboveground biomass

#main dataframe will be YEAR 100 biomass vals per sp (and maybe # cohorts too??)

#do some 2-factor ANOVAs...

#### NEED TO FIX THIS LOOP!!!!!!!!!!!! ###

#doing this first for COMBINED ash sp. ('regular' and treated ash together);
#NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN THE LOOP SO WE AREN'T 'DOUBLE COUNTING' CELLS
